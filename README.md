# ASCII-ASs
This programming language is absolute hell. For starters you get 10 Boolean values to work with- No integers, no strings; just booleans. There are three commands. So good luck actually trying to get it to do something! 
The weird language works by running your code on every single cell 1 time.
Commands:
A(65): A simple not command for the current cell
S(86): And command for the current cell and the last cell
s(115): Or command for current and last cell
____________________________________________________

These commands will get obstructed. Like say I wanted to make a simple program like this:
AS(65, 85)
But you wouldn't type it in as that. You add 10 to the ASCII value and then add the position starting at zero. So the example I showed you earlier would end up as:
75, 96 
Oh, and also I forgot to tell you you enter the ASCII values not the letter.
HAVE FUN!
